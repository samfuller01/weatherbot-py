# weatherbot-py

A Discord bot built with [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) that uses [geopy](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) to geocode locations and [a free weather api](https://openweatherapi.org) to get weather from around the
world at the request of the user.

To run on your own clone the repository, install dependencies, setup the env file with your own api key/discord token, and enjoy!
